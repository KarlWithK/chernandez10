LJ01 -- Le Voyage de Learnination avec Mongo, DeuxiÃ¨me Phase. Aim: Completed chapter 4 and learned about more operators and what the `$` means

* MQL Operators -> Provide Additional ways to locate data within the database
* Comparison Operators:
	* $eq = Equal to
	* $neq = Not Equal to
	* $gt = greator than
	* $lt = less than
	* $gte = Greator Than or Equal To
	* $lte = Less Than or Equal To
	```mongo
	db.trips.find({ "tripduration": { "$lte" : 70 },
                "usertype": { "$ne": "Subscriber" } }).pretty()
	```
	* `db.zips.find({ "pop": { "$lt" : 1000 }}).count()`
* Logic Operators:
	* `$and`: Match all of the specified query clauses - default - combine a lot of statement
	* `$or`: At least one of the query claues is matched
	* `$nor`: Fail to match both given clauses
	* `not: statement]`
* `{"$expr": {<expression>}}`
* `$`: denotes the use of an operator and address the field value
* Aggegation syntax: `{<operator>: {<field>, <value>}}`
