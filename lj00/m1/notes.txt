* THIS IDE IS HORRIBLE. Downloaded my own with: `yay -S mongo-shell-bin mongo-tools-bin`
* Collection - an organized store of documents in MongoDB usually with common fields between documents. There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.
* Document - a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs.
* Field - a unique identifier for a datapoint.
* Value - data related to a given identifier.
* Replica Set - a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that if something happens to one of the machines the data will remain intact. Comes from the word replicate - to copy something.
* Instance - a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software, in our case it is the MongoDB database.
* Cluster - group of servers that store your data.
