LJ02: Le Voyage de Learnination avec Mongo, TroisiÃ¨me Phase: Started to learn about aggregate and data modeling
2020-11-25

* Aggregation Framework: Another way to query data in MongoDB -> `aggregate` -> pipeline -> order matters
* Use Aggregation to build complex filters
* `$group`: An operator that takes the incoming stream of data, and siphons it into multiple distinct reservoirs
* Cursor Methods
	* `$sort`: sort based on find -> sorts first
	* `$limit`: get n results
	* `pretty() and count()`
* `createIndex` -> speeds up queries -> Single field index vs compound index
* `Data modeling` - a way to organize fields in a document to support your application performance and querying capabilities:
 * Data is stored in the way that it is used
* Every function that is used to locate can update a field
* `upsert` -> a hybrid of update and insert -> be careful -> set to false by default
	* true -> conditional updates
	* false -> insert a brand new document
