* "_id" is a unique identifier for a document in a collection that is required.
* Use `insert document` in the Data Explorer
* ObjectID() is the default value for the "_id" field unless otherwise specified.
* Use `--drop` for deleting duplicates when importing
* `findOne()` is a function that gives you a general outline of the document or to find a query.
* "_id" gets generated which means identical documents can exist in the same collection as long as their "_i" values are different. -> scheme validation
* you can insert multiple documents with an array in format [{}, {}, {}], {"ordered: false}
* If you misspell you create a collection.
* Arrays as a "value"
* mongo query language -> MQL
* `updateOne` and	`updateMany` -> to update
* Update Operators
	* {"$inc": {"field": "increment value"}}
	* {"$set": {"field": "new value"}} -> can create new fields
	* {"$push": {"field": "new value"}} -> adds an element at an array -> can create array field
* `deleteOne` and	`deleteMany` -> to delete:
	* "deleteOne" -> use only with "_id:11"
* delete a collection with drop -> `db.<collection>.drop()`
* db.zips.updateMany({"city": "NEW YORK"}, {"$set": {"capital?": false}})
