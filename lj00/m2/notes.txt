2020-10-27
* Use mongo "mongodb+srv://m001-student:m001-mongodb-basics@<cluster>.mongodb.net/admin" to log in
* JSON -> JavaScript Standard Object Notation with the format something like this:
	```json
	{
		"key": "value",
		"books": {
			"book1": "The Cat in The Hat",
			"book2": "Monogatari"
		},
		"num": 65
	}
	```
	* Encoded in UTF-8, Human readable, and supports only: strings, booleans, number, and arrays.
	* Pros of JSON: Friendly, Readable, and Familiar
	* On the other hand: It is Text-based, Space-Consuming, Limited.
* BSON -> Binary JSON. A format that bridges the gap between binary representation and JSON format.
	* Encoded in Binary, only readable by machines, and supports everything supported by JSON **AND** dates and raw binary.
	* MongoDB stores documents in BSON, but has all JSON features.
* Edit or make scripts with mongodb -> https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/configure-mongo-shell/
* Commands: mongodumb, mongoexport, mongorestore, and mongoimport
* mongo shell: `show dbs`, `use <collection>`, `show collections`, and `db.<collection>.find({query})`, `.count()`, and `.pretty()`
